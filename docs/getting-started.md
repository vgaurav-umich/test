# What I learned

## Setup
1. No need to add requirements.txt file
2. We will need specific version of mistune package to make it work. 
3. setup.py only needs pipenv, ploomber, and jupyterlab dependencies
4. First use `pip install -e .` command to get setup dependencies installed.
5. Then run `pipenv install -e .` to run all pipenv dependencies
